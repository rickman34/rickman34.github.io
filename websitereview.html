    <h1> Website Review</h1>
    <h2><a href="https://www.forsheytraining.com/">FTS</a></h2>
    <p>FORSHEY TRAINING SYSTEMS- I really like Forshey Training Systems website. The website is extremely easy to navigate because it is very organized and everything you need to know is just a click away on each page. The home page is very nice because it has a description of what they are all about and what they have to offer for their athletes! Their competitor in town “Built Different Performance” does not have a website, so have an organized site sets them ahead of their competitor. The websites coding is very clean and modern when looking at it. The creator used many of the basic elements that we had been taught in the early portion of the semester. Everything is organized in tables making it very good-looking organized chaos, so you know what does what. For the most part the website is black, grey, and white. However, they have red accents which add pop to the website when navigating. The website also has photos incorporated as part of the advertising which adds more color to stand out more. Everything is well labeled all the important information has either boldness, a logo, or some type of wow factor. For example, the background of the pages a faint football field design to add a little contrast to the white. </p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nike.com/">Nike</a></h3>

    <p>NIKE- Nike’s website is super simple to navigate, and I like how the homepage of the website gives images to view and click on to browse the product. The only downside to the pages is they are extremely long, but they are all filled with product to view so it distracts most people from the length. The coding of the website is modern but as soon as you open the coding it’s extremely cluster and looks very unorganized. However, as you scroll down the coding it gets cleaner and cleaner because the elements are placed in tables. The Layout of the page is very simplistic and easy to view and makes sense to me and is very easy to navigate. Whoever designed the website did a phenomenal job. Nike used a ton of colors, and this fits the company’s personality very well because they have very vibrant clothes for their running attire along with everyday attire.  I think one of the biggest things that sets Nikes website it how easy it is to view so much product in such little time. Also, on all their pictures of product they all have a little bit of a “pop” factor.</p>

  <h4><a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">Berkshire</a></h4>

    <p>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.- Berkshire Hathaway INC website is horrendous. When you open the home page it’s just so BLAH there is no wow factor whatsoever. I hate how all the website has is links that pull up different pages it just looks so lazy and unprofessional. The coding does not look very modern and is very clustered and looks unorganized just like the website. The layout makes no sense to me at all for having an 8.9-billion-dollar net income in 2021, why don’t they create a more attractive website that is easier for their clientele to navigate. I’m genuinely curious what the designers were thinking when creating this website. Were they just lazy or did they truly just not care about the website? </p>
