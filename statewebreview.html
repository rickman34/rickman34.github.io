    <h2>State Website Review</h2>

<h2><a href="https://alaska.gov/"> 1.Alaska</a></h2>
    <p>Alaska's webpage is extremely easy to navigate and you dont have to search all around the webpage to find key information. All the important information is immediately put on te front page as it opens. It also has sections that will easily guide you to what you need as a resident, business, visitor, or employee.</p>

<h2><a href="https://delaware.gov/">2.Delaware</a></h2>
    <p>Delaware's front page is loaded with all the key information you need to begin your search. However, their website is extremely long they should keep pages short and sweet with the key information people want to see.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.myflorida.com/">3.Florida</a></h2>
    <p>Florida's page is very bland there is really no wow factor to the site. The page kind of seems like they did not focus on all the little details. For example the background does not even reach the bottom of the front page. I feel this is the worst site because of the lack of effort put in. </p>

<h2><a href="https://www.illinois.gov/">4.Illinois</a></h2>
    <p>Illinois' webpagr is very organized and has key information listed as alerts on the front page of the site. They also have a virtual assistant which is very unique and allows users to get things done quicker if they are unsure.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.nebraska.gov/">5.Nebraska</a></h2>
    <p>I like how Nebraska has the live stream of their governers social media feeds so information is directly uploaded to both. The webpage is very easy to use and everything is linked alphabetically. </p>
